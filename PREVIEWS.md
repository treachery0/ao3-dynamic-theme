# Previews

**All Preview images are auto-generated and might contain explicit content!**

That being said, shoutout to the random dead dove fic that will inevitably get featured as the first result.

## Generating previews

Preview generation is configurable in `preview.config.js`.

- Run `npm run preview` to regenerate all images.
- Run `npm run preview-live` to view the selected pages in your local browser.
